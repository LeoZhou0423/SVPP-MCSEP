# This file demonstrates how to organize start points, waypoints, and end points
# in a single file using section markers.

# START_POINTS section - defines possible starting locations
# START_POINTS

20, 5, 10     # Alternative start point 2

# WAYPOINTS section - defines intermediate points that must be visited
# WAYPOINTS
30, 30, 20    # Waypoint 1
40, 45, 25    # Waypoint 2
50, 35, 15    # Waypoint 3
60, 50, 30    # Waypoint 4

# END_POINTS section - defines possible ending locations
# END_POINTS
80, 70, 40    # End point 1
90, 80, 45    # End point 2
